autowiring feat of spring framework enables us to inject the object dependency impplicitly.
it internally uses setter or constructor injection
autowiring cannot be used to inject primitve and string values.
it works with refrence only
Types:
 XML
 
adv : 
it requires less code because we don't need to write the code to inject the dependency implicity
autowiring mode : 
no -> default autowiring mode
byName -> byName Autowiring mode injects the dependency according to the name of the bean
		in such case, property name & bean name must be same
		it internally uses setter method
byType -> according to the type, in such case propety name & bean name may not be the same, it internally uses setter method
constructor -> it injects the dependency by calling the contructor of the class
autoDetect -> it is deprecated since spring 3
